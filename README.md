# Eleuthera Flora Tracker

This repository hosts a sample dataset of digitized herbarium specimens originally collected on Eleuthera, Bahamas, but hosted by a variety of herbaria. The project demonstrates how to track, curate, and organize botanical specimen data in a transparent, reproducible way using Git and GitHub.

## Project Purpose

- Support open, organized sharing of plant specimen metadata for conservation and ecological research.
- Provide an example workflow for specimen data cleaning and version tracking.
- Showcase data stewardship skills relevant to conservation science and biodiversity monitoring.

## Dataset

The sample CSV file (`eleuthera-flora-sample.csv`) includes categories:

- Herbarium
- Family, genus, specific epithet
- Subspecies/variety
- Author(s)
- Date collected
- Collector
- Collection location

**Note:** Only a small subset of the full dataset is included to demonstrate structure and workflow.

## Potential Future Work

- Standardize collector and location names.
- Add visualizations (e.g., family-level summary plots).
- Integrate geographic mapping of specimens with coordinates (if applicable).
- Link to herbarium images or voucher records.

## How to Contribute

- Open an issue to suggest improvements or fixes.
- Create a branch for any data cleaning or analysis changes.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description.
